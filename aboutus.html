<p class="paragraph">
   We are a new troop and were recently founded in 2016 in the Apex, North Carolina area. We belong to the North Carolina Pines division of Girl Scouts and currently have approximately 10 girls who are members of the troop. As mentioned on the front page of our website, our adult leaders are Mrs. Penelope Wagner and Mrs. Pragna Panchal, who deserve tremendous amount of credit for making this possible. We generally meet on the 1st and 3rd Sunday of every month and hold these meetings at the AC Moore store located in the Beaver Creek Commons of Apex. The specific address of our meetings is 1041 Beaver Creek Commons Drive Apex, NC 27502. Our meetings typically last from 4:00-5:00 pm so if you are interested in joining Girl Scouts or bringing your daughter to join, feel free to attend one of meetings for a brief overview of what to expect.

<font face="impact" size="5"><h2>What We Offer</h2></font><hr><br><br>
<p class="paragraph">
    Our troop offers everything that is a part of the Girl Scouts tradition! From camp-outs to earning badges, our troop does a tremendous job of balancing fun and hard work. Our scouts are extremely ambitious so it is extremely common for them to be working on multiple badges per month. Another aspect our Girl Scouts take part in is the Girl Scout Cookie season in which they put in so much effort. The cookie season is truly an exciting as we see the girls show off their advertising skills. In the midst of all this hard work, our troop also takes part in so many fun events together. One such event one can point to is the Wake Roller Skating Party hosted earlier in Summer 2017.
